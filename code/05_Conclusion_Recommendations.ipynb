    "> Our model is a failed model. It predicts incorrectly 4/5ths of the time. That is not a case for a successful model. Our baseline was 0.0397 and although we achieved our metric of success, 0.178, it is nowhere near production ready and needs more time to develop. We've learn quite a bit from this experience and realize that predicting something as subjective as art is a difficult task, especially with 51 labels. I hope that you learn from our mistakes and find the same growth we have in this process."

    "- More time : Given another week to experiment with the following steps I strongly feel we could've gotten better results.\n",
    "- More Processing power : this was a severe limitation on our project, as many models often had to run overnight on only 5 epochs.\n",
    "- Combine like art styles (High/Early/Late Renaissance) : 51 classes is a tall order\n",
    "- Higher resolution images : Could've possibly improved model accuracy, but would also increase amount of time needed to run\n",
    "- Using only most populated classes : less classes and plenty of data to use, however this reduces the overall size of the data drastically\n",
    "- Using models other than CNN : we put most of our focus into making this type of neural network work, but other types such as Deep Neural Networks or utilizing Transfer Learning could have improved our prediction ability"
